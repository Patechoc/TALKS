2012-NKSmeeting-SenjaTroms-_PARI_analysis
=========================================

Talk about the PARI approximations: its potential in 99% of the cases,  and its inherent faliure, with an analysis of the popping-up *non*-positive-definite approximation to the Coulomb operator. These lead in 1% of the cases to unphysical attractive electron/electron interactions and consequently the downfall of the energy during the SCF procedure.
